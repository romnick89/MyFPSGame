3D game I built in Unity Engine during my final year.

This game was not developed as a browser based but for PC, Mac & Linux 
Standalone. So, there may be some lagging issues during gameplay.

UI text may not be displayed accordingly, as I was not able implement UI design that is compatible with 
different types of resolution. I recommend using high display resolution as I built the 
project using 3840 x 2160 display resolution. I apologise for any inconvenience.

Of course, there were certainly more bugs and plenty things that can be improved with 
this project but overall, I enjoyed creating them and proud of what I have accomplished.
